### Project description:
RSS, which stands for Really Simple Syndication, is a web feed standard that allows users to access updates to online content in a standardized, computer-readable format. These feeds can include blog entries, news headlines, audio, and video.



Instead of manually visiting multiple websites to check for new articles, individuals can use an RSS aggregator, or feed reader, to subscribe to these feeds. The aggregator automatically collects and displays content from all subscribed sources in a single, consolidated location, providing a efficient way to stay current with information from across the web.
